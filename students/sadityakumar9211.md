```c
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(){
    cout<<"I am trying to make a pull request...";
    return 0;
}
```

```javascript
function main(){
    console.log(`I am trying to make a pull request...`)
}
main()
```

```python
print(f"I am trying to make a pull request...")
```

import "hardhat/console.sol"

contract PullRequest{
    function display() public pure {
        console.log("I am trying to make a pull request")
    }
}
```
